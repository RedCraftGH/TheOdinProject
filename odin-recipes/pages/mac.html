            <ol>
                <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Butter a 3-quart baking dish or individual gratin dishes with nonstick cooking spray.</p></li>
                <li><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to the package directions, 6 to 8 minutes, or until al dente. Drain.</p></li>
                <li><p>Meanwhile, in a small saucepan set over medium heat, warm the milk. Stir together kosher salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, ground mustard, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, & paprika in a small bowl, and set aside.</p></li>
                <li><p>In a large saucepan set over medium-low heat, heat 1 stick of butter until melted. Sprinkle the flour into the saucepan and cook for 2 minutes, whisking constantly. Gradually whisk in the hot milk and cook for about 3 minutes, until thickened and smooth, and the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Whisk in the spice blend and red wine vinegar. Remove from heat.</p></li>
                <li><p>Slowly whisk a spoonful of sauce into a small bowl with the beaten egg, to temper the egg. Add egg mixture into the sauce. Add in the cheeses and whisk until cheese is melted. Stir in pasta, then pour into prepared baking dish.</p></li>
                <li><p>Mix panko bread crumbs, fresh thyme leaves, and melted butter in a small bowl until combined. Sprinkle bread crumb mixture evenly over the top of the macaroni and cheese.
