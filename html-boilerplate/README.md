In this project I began diving into the wonderful world of HTML. I discovered a few of the common element tags and learned the structure of an HTML file. I also created the boilerplate index.html to streamline the beginning of any new projects I may undertake.

Some of the HTML tags I encountered:
    - <html></html>
    - <head></head>
    - <title></title>
    - <meta>
    - <body></body>
