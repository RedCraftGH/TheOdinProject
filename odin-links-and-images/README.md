This project continued introducing me to HTML and making more tags available to me. The project made me aware of the different types of links, absolute and relative, and how each is used. Relative links connect the pages of a website together and absolute links connect the pages of seperate websites together. Furthermore in this project I began to implement some pictures using the <img> tag. I learned of some of the attributes one might or must declare within certain HTML tags such as 'width' or 'alt' for an image. And finally I learned about the different types of images that might be included on a website and the use cases for each.
